## Major Fixes and Improvements

### 1. ODJ Product Images - Symbol Link Conversion

**Problem**: ODJ product images were stored as symbolic links, which do not work on GitHub Pages or web servers.

**Solution**: Converted all 10 ODJ product image symbolic links to real image files by copying the target files.

**Affected Files**:
- `images/products/odj-bys-1.jpg` (91KB)
- `images/products/odj-fp1650-1.jpg` (273KB)
- `images/products/odj-jxb-1.jpg` (78KB)
- `images/products/odj-jxb-2.jpg` (233KB)
- `images/products/odj-md350-1.jpg` (97KB)
- `images/products/odj-md350-2.jpg` (206KB)
- `images/products/odj-qsl2-1.jpg` (142KB)
- `images/products/odj-qsl3-1.jpg` (127KB)
- `images/products/odj-qsl4-1.jpg` (68KB)
- `images/products/odj-qxy3-1.jpg` (93KB)

**Impact**: ODJ product images now display correctly across all platforms.

### 2. Product Detail Page - Link Correction

**Problem**: Product detail links were pointing to non-existent `product-detail-dynamic.html` file, causing "Loading..." errors.

**Solution**: Replaced all references to `product-detail-dynamic.html` with `product-detail.html` across the entire codebase.

**Modified Files**:
- `company-detail-loader.js`
- All HTML files referencing product detail pages

**Impact**: Product detail pages now load correctly, displaying:
- Product name, model, and specifications
- Product images
- Supplier information
- Main features and capabilities
- Related products recommendations

### 3. Customer Detail Page - Type Parameter Fix

**Problem**: Customer detail pages were not loading when accessed with `type=buyer` parameter, showing "Invalid company type" error.

**Solution**: Updated `company-detail-loader.js` to accept both `type=customer` and `type=buyer` parameters.

**Modified Files**:
- `company-detail-loader.js` (line 18)

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Before
} else if (companyType === 'customer') {

// After
} else if (companyType === 'customer' || companyType === 'buyer') {
```

**Impact**: Customer detail pages now work with both URL parameter formats.

### 4. Customer Information Enrichment

**Problem**: Customer profiles lacked detailed information such as company logos, comprehensive About Us sections, contact details, and website URLs.

**Solution**: Conducted comprehensive research on 10 Mexican buyer companies, extracting and translating information from their official websites.

**Data Collection Process**:
1. Visited each company's official website
2. Downloaded company logos in high quality
3. Extracted and translated About Us sections to English
4. Collected complete contact information (phone, email, address)
5. Identified product types and business scope
6. Verified founding years and company history

### 5. Customer Detail Page - Logo Display

**Problem**: Customer detail pages did not display company logos.

**Solution**: Added logo display functionality to customer detail pages.

**Modified Files**:
- `company-detail.html` - Added logo container and image element
- `company-detail-loader.js` - Added logic to display logo when available

**HTML Addition**:
```html
<div id="company-logo-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: none;">
    <img id="company-logo" src="" alt="Company Logo" 
         style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 80px; background: white; 
                padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>
```

**JavaScript Addition**:
```javascript
// Display company logo if available
if (customer.logo) {
    const logoContainer = document.getElementById('company-logo-container');
    const logoImg = document.getElementById('company-logo');
    logoImg.src = customer.logo;
    logoContainer.style.display = 'block';
}
```

**Impact**: Customer logos now display prominently on their detail pages.

---

### 6. About Us Section Enhancement

**Problem**: Customer detail pages showed generic descriptions instead of actual company information.

**Solution**: Updated `displayCustomerInfo` function to prioritize `aboutUs` field over generic `description`.

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Before
document.getElementById('company-description').textContent = 
    customer.description || customer.businessDescription || 'Leading corrugated packaging manufacturer...';

// After
document.getElementById('company-description').textContent = 
    customer.aboutUs || customer.description || customer.businessDescription || 'Leading corrugated packaging manufacturer...';
```

**Impact**: Customer detail pages now display authentic company information translated from their official websites.

### Cache Busting

To ensure browsers load the updated JavaScript files, version parameters have been added to script tags:

```

This forces browsers to reload the JavaScript file instead of using cached versions.

## Known Issues

### Logo Display in Cached Browser Sessions

**Issue**: In browser sessions with cached data, customer logos may not display immediately due to JSON file caching.

**Workaround**: 
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Use incognito/private browsing mode
- Wait for browser cache to expire (typically 24 hours)

**Status**: This is a browser caching issue and will resolve automatically in production. The logo display code and data are correctly implemented.

   - Product catalog PDF
